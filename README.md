This project is a console-based quiz application developed in C++ that allows users to test their knowledge in three subjects: C++, Python, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The quiz system is designed for educational purposes, enabling students to practice and assess their understanding through interactive multiple-choice questions.

üí° Key Features:
User Information Input: The quiz begins by asking the user for their name and roll number, which are later displayed in the final result report.

Subject Selection: Users are given the option to choose one quiz at a time from the following:

C++

Python

OOP

Multiple Attempts Restriction: Each quiz can only be attempted once per session to ensure fairness and avoid repetition.

Question Bank:

Each subject contains 10 multiple-choice questions.

Every question offers 4 options (a, b, c, d).

Questions are stored in 2D character arrays for organized access.

Answer Evaluation:

After answering the questions, the user's choices are compared with the correct answers stored in predefined arrays.

A score is calculated based on the number of correct responses.

Result Summary:

Displays the total score out of 30 after all three quizzes are completed.

Shows individual scores for Python, C++, and OOP quizzes.

Provides pass/fail status based on a 50% passing criterion (i.e., 15 out of 30).

User-Friendly Interface:

The application uses system("cls") and system("pause") to provide a clean, step-by-step experience.

Clear instructions are shown before the quizzes start.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Aspects:
Programming Language: C++

Concepts Used:

Arrays (2D arrays and character arrays)

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Loops (for, while)

Basic I/O Operations

String Handling

Platform: Console Application (Windows)

üìö Learning Objectives:
This project helps students to:

Strengthen their understanding of C++ syntax and logic building.

Learn about string manipulation and user interaction in console programs.

Understand the basic structure of quiz systems and logic-based evaluation.

Practice OOP, Python, and C++ concepts interactively.
